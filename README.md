### Experience  
Open-source contributor to chaos™. Former VP of Unreadable Code at The Department of Unclear Requirements. Architect of "It Works On My Machine" solutions since yesterday. 
Inventor of the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ deployment pipeline and certified in Quantum/Atomic Merge Conflicts. 

### Currently Learning  
- Using Arch Linux physically BTW.
- Recursive recursion
- Uncertainty-Driven Development
- Rat-based computing (ratputer v2 beta)
- Replacing meetings with structured rat fights
- Cubic regression in gorilla-based models
- Passive-aggressive CI/CD
- Vim exit strategies
- Whether Neovim is editing me back

### Core Beliefs
- My Neovim config is sentient and resents me
- No gorilla should face more than 49 men alone — I have ethics
- If it’s not in dark mode, I can’t trust it.
- If it compiled, I didn’t write enough tests to deserve that.
- Vim Exiting is a form of enlightenment
